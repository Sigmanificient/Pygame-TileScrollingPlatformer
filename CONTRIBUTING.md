## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:

- Makes sure to have the right python version and the project dependencies
  installed.
- Looks at the current version project to see if anything is still in progress.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using the template. We'll use the issue
to have a conversation about the problem you found.

### Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update to solve an issue or
implement a missing feature.

- Make sure to implement something that is related to the current version !
- If you want to change something within an old version, don't ask to push it to
  the main but in its own branch !

### Open a pull request

When you're done making changes, and you'd like to propose them for review, use
the pull request template to open your PR (pull request).

- I might take up to 24 hours to get your code reviewed, testing and merged.
- If you remove any feature, or don't pass the basic tests and code style your
  pull request might not get approved and will be asked for modifications
